## Does paying Lebron James more money increase his performance?

There's long been a debate about whether professional athletes actually earn the money they are paid. As the the salary caps for the United States' professional sports leagues have ballooned over past couple decades, has it actually made athletes' performances any better?

To explore this question, we'll use Lebron James, one of the greatest basketball players ever, as a case study. In evaluating if increasing the salaries of players improves performance, we'll consider a few key statistics in basketball. Among them, win percentage and effective field goal percentage. Obviously basketball is a team sport, and that's why I felt it was important to include effective field goal percentage in this discussion, as it is a truly individual statistic.
