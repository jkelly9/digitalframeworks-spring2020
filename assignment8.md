## Assignment 8: Find a story

### Answers

I found that online fundraising platforms WinRed and ActBlue have a series of "power" donors that give small amounts to political campaigns many times over a short period of time. 

To follow up on this story, I would interview a few of these power donors to understand what gets them to keep giving to candidates -- one woman in Wisconsin donated 369 times to Bernie Sanders via ActBlue since Jan. 1 2019. I would also interview a money-in-politics expert to understand changes in the way Americans contribute to political campaigns. I would also look at some of the historical data from ActBlue (WinRed has only been around for a little over a year) to see if these power donors in Wisocnsin have become more common as "anti-establishmet" politicians like  Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez became more popular in the state (Sanders won the state's 2016 presidenteial primary, but was easily defeated by Biden this year).

In order to find my story, I did the following:

1. Went to the FEC's website and searched for ActBlue.
2. Clicked to view their receipts.
3. Filtered these receipts to only include contributions from people in Wisconsin and exported the results to a CSV.
4. I manually cleaned the data by deleting the columns I didn't want. 
5. Then, using a pivot table, I filtered the data by candidate to the power donors for Sanders (I selected Sanders because he significantly outraised Biden in Wisconsin during the 2020 cycle).
6. I repeated the previous steps on WinRed's filings to find Trump's power donors.

Hed: Show me the money: Candidates receive flurry of micro-donations from ActBlue, WinRed

Nut graf: The rise of online fundraising platforms ActBlue and WinRed have transformed the way Americans donate to political campaigns. Gone are the days of snail-mailing checks to support candidates. Instead, many users are now repeatedly providing micro-donations to their favorite politicians online. 

Just how often are people giving? Very often. One woman in Wisconsin donated 369 times to Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign in just 15 months.
