# Assignment 6: Interview a dataset 

## Background 
A co-counselor from a summer camp I volunteer with is running for state Assembly here in Wisconsin. Jacob Malinowski, a recent graduate of Yale University, is running as a Democrat against incumbent Rep. Ken Skowronski, a Republican. I wanted to know, based on previous elections, how Jacob might fair if he makes it to the general election in November. If victorious, he'll reprsent Wisconsin's 82nd Assembly district. 

Also, as a disclaimer, I would like to highlight that I am not forecasting election results, but instead looking at results from previous elections to see if a Democrat could compete in a district where the incumbent ran against only a Libertarian in the general election in 2018.

## Questions

1. Who won the district in last month's Wisconsin Supreme Court election? How close was the race?
..* Annoyingly, the Wisconsin Election Commission does not release election results on a district-by-district basis. However, they do release the results ward-by-ward, which will allow me to approximate the election results in the 82nd assembly district by totalling the votes of the communities the district represents. The three priamary communities encompassed in this district are Franklin, Greendale and Greenfield.

2. How did those results comapare to 2019's non-presidential Wisconsin Supreme Court race?

3. How did the district vote in the 2016 state Supreme Court race, and how do those results compare to 2019 and 2020?
