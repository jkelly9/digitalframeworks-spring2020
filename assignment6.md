# Assignment 6: Interview a dataset 

## Background 
A co-counselor from a summer camp I volunteer with is running for state Assembly here in Wisconsin. Jacob Malinowski, a recent graduate of Yale University, is running as a Democrat against incumbent Rep. Ken Skowronski, a Republican. I wanted to know, based on previous elections, how Jacob might fair if he makes it to the general election in November. If victorious, he'll reprsent Wisconsin's 82nd Assembly district. 

Also, as a disclaimer, I would like to highlight that I am not forecasting election results, but instead looking at results from previous elections to see if a Democrat could compete in a district where the incumbent ran against only a Libertarian in the general election in 2018.

## Questions

1.) Who won the district in last month's Wisconsin Supreme Court election? How close was the race?
* Annoyingly, the Wisconsin Election Commission does not release election results on a district-by-district basis. However, they do release the results ward-by-ward, which will allow me to approximate the election results in the 82nd assembly district by totalling the votes of the communities the district represents. (1) The three priamary communities encompassed in this district are Franklin, Greendale and Greenfield, so I started cleaning the vast dataset from the 2020 election by gathering the election results from these three communities. (2) Next, using excel, I totalled the votes for each candidate from the three communities using a simple =SUM() function. In the 50-or-so wards in these three communities, incumbent Justice Dan Kelly (a conservative) received 12,944 votes, and challenger (and eventual election winner) Judge Jill Karofsky (a liberal) earned 12,941 votes. This result was much close than I anticipated, as a Democrat did not even run for state assembly in this district in 2018.

2.) How did those results comapare to 2019's non-presidential Wisconsin Supreme Court race?

3.) How did the district vote in the 2016 state Supreme Court race, and how do those results compare to 2019 and 2020?
