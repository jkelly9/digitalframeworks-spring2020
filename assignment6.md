# Assignment 6: Interview a dataset 

## Background 
A co-counselor from a summer camp I volunteer with is running for state Assembly here in Wisconsin. Jacob Malinowski, a recent graduate of Yale University, is running as a Democrat against incumbent Rep. Ken Skowronski, a Republican. I wanted to know, based on previous elections, how Jacob might fair if he makes it to the general election in November. If victorious, he'll represent Wisconsin's 82nd Assembly district. 

Also, as a disclaimer, I would like to highlight that I am not forecasting election results, but instead looking at results from previous elections to see if a Democrat could compete in a district where the incumbent ran against only a Libertarian in the general election in 2018.

## Questions

1.) Who won the district in last month's Wisconsin Supreme Court election? How close was the race?
* Annoyingly, the Wisconsin Election Commission does not release election results on a district-by-district basis. However, they do release the results ward-by-ward, which will allow me to approximate the election results in the 82nd assembly district by totalling the votes of the communities the district represents. (1) The three primary communities encompassed in this district are Franklin, Greendale and Greenfield, so I started cleaning the vast dataset from the 2020 election by gathering the election results from these three communities. (2) Next, using excel, I totalled the votes for each candidate from the three communities using a simple =SUM() function. In the 50-or-so wards in these three communities, incumbent Justice Dan Kelly (a conservative) received 12,944 votes, and challenger (and eventual election winner) Judge Jill Karofsky (a liberal) earned 12,941 votes. This result was much closer than I anticipated, as a Democrat did not even run for state assembly in this district in 2018.

2.) How did those results comapare to 2019's non-presidential Wisconsin Supreme Court race?
* In 2019, unsuprisingly, voter turnout was down, as it usually is in a non-presidential election year. To clean the data, I did the same steps as above. Last year's April election had 19,762 vote in the state Supreme Court election, 6,140 fewer people than in 2020. However, in 2019, the conservative candidate faired much better than in 2020. Brian Hagedorn won 58% of the vote (11,468 votes) compared to Lisa  Neubauer's roughly 42% (8,278 votes). That is a significantly higher share of the vote than Kelly won, suggesting that the Democratic primary drove more liberal-minded voters to the poll.  


3.) How did the district vote in the 2016 state Supreme Court race? And how do those results compare to 2019 and 2020?
* In 2016, also a presidential election year (this time both parties were electing a nominee), the conservative candidate performed even better. Rebecca Bradley, a conservative, earned 59.7% (19,306 votes) of the vote in the three communities. Liberal JoAnne Kloppenburg earned just 40% of the vote (12,921 votes). I'm not sure how to react to this result. On the one hand, Wisconsin gave Sen. Bernie Sanders a key victory against Secretary Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary, suggesting liberal voters went to the polls in numbers. But Wisconsin was also a big victory for Sen. Ted Cruz, then candidate Donald Trump's main rival, suggesting voters were attracted to Cruz's more mainstream conservatism.

I would also like to note the election results of the 2018 Wisconsin Supreme Court. Liberal Rebecca Dallet defeated conservative Michael Screnock in the state-wide race, but not in these three communities. In Greendale, Franklin and Greenfield, Screnock earned 53.3% of the vote (9,196 votes) while Dallet earned 46.6% of the vote (8,033 votes).

## Democrat challenger Malinowski running against GOP incumbemt in up-and-down district for liberals

Jacob Malinowksi, a 22-year-old political newcomer and recent graduate of Yale University, is challenging incumbent Republican Rep. Ken Skowronski in a district that has show mixed support for liberal-leaning candidates in recent years, according to an analysis of state-level nonpartisan elections. 

Skowronski, 82,  was first elected in late 2013 and has not faced a Democratic challenger in his last two campaigns. However, election results from Wisconsin's four most recent state Supreme Court elections suggest that liberal candidates can overperform in the right conditions. 

In 2016, during the country's last presidential primaries, conservative candidate and now Justice Rebecca Bradley earned 59.7% of votes in Greendale, Franklin and Greenfield, the three major communities the 82nd Assembly district encompasses. In 2018 and 2019 -- non-presidential election years -- conservative candidates for the state's high-court received 53.3% and 58% of the vote from the three communities respectively. In April's Supreme Court election, Justice Dan Kelly received 12,944 votes and Jill Karofsky received 12,941 votes, a virtual 50/50 split. These results suggest that under the right conditions, Malinowski can compete in earnest in November.
