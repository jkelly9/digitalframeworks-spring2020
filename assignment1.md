## Story Ideas:
* (1) What will WinRed's impact be on congressional races in Wisconsin?
  * Having grown up and reported in Wisconsin, a Petri dish of partisanship, it has come to my attention that America's Dairyland is often exempt from national political trends. Namely, politicians and political candidates rarely have the luxury of rejecting super PAC support if they want to be competitive in often contentious races. In an already heavily gerrymandered state, Democrats struggle to be competitive in 5 of Wisconsin's 8 congressional districts. Now, GOP candidates are receiving seemingly anonymous money from WinRed, a small-dollar, conservative digital donations platform that has been endorsed by President Trump. Republican congressional races in Wisconsin are raking in $10,000s from WinRed, and the source of the funds appears to be anonymous. I want to dig into the FEC filings of WinRed to see I am able to determine who is contributing to Wisconsin's GOP House candidates, and why they are doing so through an intermediary instead of just giving to campaigns directly. 

* (2) Has raising the salary cap increased the quality of basketball in the NBA?
 * Since 1984, the NBA has had a salary cap. A salary cap is a rule that limits the amount of money teams can spend on players' salaries. However, since it was introduced in 1984, the salary cap has ballooned. For the current NBA season -- which sits in limbo -- the salary cap is $109 million. On another note, since 1984, team offensive and defensive efficieny have been measured. Offensive effeciency is how many points per 100 possessions a team scores. Defensive effeciency, on the other hand, is, you may have guessed it, how many points a team allows per 100 possessions. I would like to do an analysis of whether increasing the salary cap -- in theory incentivizing players to work harder for more money -- has made teams more efficient. Or, a simpler way to put it: Has increasing NBA player wages improved the quality of basketball?
 
 ## Story Examples:
 
 ### Democratic online donations hit $1 billion mark in 2019 as Republicans make strides to catch up ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/blog/meet-press-blog-latest-news-analysis-data-driving-political-discussion-n988541/ncrd1112901#blogHeader))
* This story from NBC News provides a fundraising comparison between WinRed and its Democratic counterpart, ActBlue, for 2019. The headline, "Democratic online donations hit $1 billion mark in 2019 as Republicans make strides to catch up," identifies the central insight from the reporter: That ActBlue crushes WinRed in scale. However, I would say that "makes strides to catch up" is not the most accurate description of what is actually happening. ActBlue raised over $1 billion in 2019; WinRed raised $101 million. In this category I would give the piece 4/5.
* The story is a little peculiar to me, though. Rather than creating their own charts to compare the two fundraising platforms, they relied on graphics tweeted out by the two organizations. This made the data a little more difficult to follow, because both organizations are pushing their own narratives in the graphics. Even a simple bar graph would have been useful to show just how many more dollars ActBlue took in compared to WinRed. The data was also not the easiest thing to find. The charts shared in the two organizations' tweets are not the easiest to understand. Honestly, hitting control f and searching for "$" was the best way to find the data that I wanted. I give the story 2/5 in this category. 
* The data utilized in the story would appear to be accurate to me. Even though it was self-reported from the two fundraising organizations, they had to release full reports of the data by the end of the month. I don't see any reason as to why they would lie, just to be found out a handful of days later. However, because the data could not be verified, I give it a 3/5.
* This piece was average quality. It does a good job of providing the history of the two fundraising platforms, as well as why ActBlue is outperforming WinRed by such a large margin, as well as getting the important data out front. However, it doesn't make any meaningful data-driven comparisons. Also, the piece could have used another round of edits to address some loose writing. In terms of quality, I give the piece a 3/5.
* The graphics from ActBlue and WinRed included in the story are simple and straightforward. However, given the fact that NBC News failed to provide any substantive graphics of their own, I don't think this category warrants a score.
* I give this piece a 2/5 for creativity. They took a big swing-and-miss on expressing just how much money $1 billion can mean to political races. Instead they opted for a quick hit as a part of a blog post. Creativity score: 1/5.

### After 60 Games, There Is No ‘Race’ For The NBA MVP ([Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/shaneyoung/2020/03/02/after-60-games-there-is-no-race-for-the-nba-mvp/#3a15aa5a7db7))
* This piece, which makes the case that the Milwaukee Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo has the NBA MVP race locked up, is packed full of data. The primary insight of this piece is that there actually really isn't a race for the league's MVP award, which is apparent if one reads the headline. In terms of clarity of message, I give this piece a 5/5.
* I also find the data in this piece extremely easy to follow. Despite the fact that the author references just about every advanced statistic tracked for NBA players, it's not hard to follow his writing and understand the points he is making. The easiest way to follow the data, which was, for the most part, just included in the body of the text, was to simply read the piece. The author explains how most of the metrics are calculated right before/after he references them. One recommendation for improving the data navigating experience, though, would be to cut some of the data out. The author includes several sections on data that is not important to his main thesis, and excluding it from the piece could help make it more digestible. Score 4/5.
I also think this data is accurate. Though the piece does not reveal the source of all of the data, it is likely that it comes from Basketball Reference. Basketball Reference provides data for most major news organizations' websites. I would give the accuracy 4/5.
* Overall I think this piece is very high quality. It is full of useful insights from the author and helps the reader understand what is fueling Lebron James' MVP candidacy (mostly name recognition and TV market size). The table included in the piece comparing Steph Curry and Antetokounmpo is also very effective and easy to understand. I give this piece a 5/5 for quality.
* The colors and fonts included in the table comparing the two MVPs are simple and effective. Curry's stats are in a Warrior-blue box  and Giannis' stats are in a Bucks-green box. The font, Calibri, is a sans-serif that is good for reading on screens. Additionally, the rows alternate colors helping make it easier to distinguish each line of data from the other. The graph is fairly simple from a design perspective, though. Score: 3/5.
* In the creativity department I give this piece a 4/5. While the data presentation could have been more engaging. The point the author is making is salient and the argument of the piece is highly effective.
