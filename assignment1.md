* (1) What will WinRed's impact be on congressional races in Wisconsin?
  * Having grown up and reported in Wisconsin, a Petri dish of partisanship, it has come to my attention that America's Dairyland is often exempt from national political trends. Namely, politicians and political candidates rarely have the luxury of rejecting super PAC money if they want to be competitive in often contentious races. As the November elections loom, this continues to be true. In an already heavily gerrymandered state, Democrats struggle to be competitive in 5 of Wisconsin's 8 congressional districts. Now, they are receiving seemingly anonymous money from WinRed, a small-dollar, conservative digital donations platform that has been endorsed by President Trump. Republican congressional races in Wisconsin are raking in $10,000s of dollars from WinRed, and the source of the funds appears to be anonymous. I want to dig into the FEC filings of WinRed to see I am able to determine who is contributing to Wisconsin's GOP House candidates, and why they are doing so through an intermediary instead of just giving to campaigns directly.
