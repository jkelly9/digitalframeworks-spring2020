# Assignment 4: Story Pitch

I plan to analyze how much donors using WinRed and Act Blue, online fundraising platforms for Republicans and Democrats respectively, are giving to candidates in Wisconsin as we approach the 2020 elections. What I want to find is how much money being given via these platforms are coming from outside the state, and what implication that has on elections here in Wisconsin. I also want to find if increased small-dollar donations on these platforms are met with increased spending from super PACs in Wisconsin.

To do this, I will analyze FEC filings from WinRed, Act Blue, candidates running for office, PACs and super PACs. I would also like to explore Facebook’s Ad Library to see if I can find some geographical data about where candidates and PACs are targeting their digital ad buys.

I could visualize a comparison of total campaign fundraising versus total share of the vote won, as well as where super PACs are focusing their ad buys and how that money impacts election outcomes. 

This is timely because of the looming presidential election. Additionally, Wisconsin is holding a special congressional election on May 12, which could serve as a valuable case study for understanding how small-dollar donations impact elections in the state.

For sources, I would also like to speak with political experts from Wisconsin -- UW-Madison’s Barry Burden, for example -- about the impact money has on electoral outcomes in the state. I would also like to connect with campaign and super PAC staffers to better understand their decision-making processes when it comes to ads.
